Here is my attempt in practicing Day 3 - Function calling with the Gemini API.
I used Google Collab.
I made a Hogwarts Students Grades database containing information about students, houses, subjects, ratings, and their grades and a  helpful chatbot that can interact with the database. 
Here are the functions the chatbot can do: list_tables, describe_table, execute_query, describe_table_interconnections.
But I am getting OperationalError when I ask very specific questions like:
What rating Harry Potter got in the subject Charms? or What house Harry Potter belongs to?

![error 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d66bccd-75f6-4c8f-bbe6-2fec396acb18)

Any insights or suggestions to improve the database and chatbot's functionality are welcome!
